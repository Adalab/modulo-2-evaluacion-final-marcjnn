# Evaluaci√≥n final - modulo 2 - JavaScript

I created this project during [Adalab Bootcamp](https://adalab.es/), at the end of JavaScript module using the provided [Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit).

It is a simple browser, where one can search through a series database and store her favorite series.

**JavaScript:**

- AJAX request to public API
- favorite series stored in local storage
- adding to / removing from list of favorites when clicked on a serie card
- buttons in favorites series for removing individually or all at once
- updating styles depending whether the series is favorite

**HTML & CSS:**

- working with partials
- HTML semantic structure
- CSS based on grid and flexbox
- SASS (nesting, variables, mixins)

You can check the final result [HERE](http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-marcjnn/).
